# ⚡ PotifyGo v1.1-BETA

**Spotify downloads as simple as they should be.** Tired of messy CLI tools? PotifyGo combines the raw power of `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` with a sleek, modern Svelte interface. Just paste your link, hit the button, and let the magic happen.

## 🔥 Features

- **High-Speed Downloads:** Powered by `yt-dlp` for maximum performance.
- **Modern UI:** Built with Wails & Svelte (Dark mode isn't a choice, it's a lifestyle).
- **Self-Contained:** The app automatically migrates `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp` to your AppData folder on the first launch.
- **Live Terminal Log:** Watch exactly what's happening under the hood in real-time.

2. Download the `PotifyGo_Release.zip`.
3. Extract the entire folder.
